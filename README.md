# 👋 Hi, I'm Anshul Tiwari

Frontend Engineer building at the intersection of **AI × Web3**, focused on turning complex decentralized infrastructure into intuitive, usable products.

## 🚀 My Journey

My journey into tech started with curiosity about intelligent systems and how software can reshape industries.

I transitioned into full-stack development and gradually moved into the Web3 ecosystem — where decentralization, data ownership, and trustless architecture completely changed how I think about building products.

Today, I focus on designing and developing applications that bridge **AI systems with decentralized infrastructure**.

## 🧠 What I Do Now

Currently working as a Frontend Developer, building high-performance interfaces and simulation-based financial products.

I actively explore:

- AI-native Web3 applications  
- Decentralized data ownership models  
- Trusted compute systems  
- Developer experience for protocol ecosystems  
- Scalable frontend architecture  

I enjoy translating complex protocol or backend systems into seamless user experiences.
