# 👋 Hi, I'm Anshul Tiwari

Frontend Engineer building at the intersection of **AI × Web3**, focused on turning complex decentralized infrastructure into usable products.

## 🚀 My Journey

I started my career as an Industrial Engineer at TDK, leading a 25-member production team working on Samsung & Vivo battery manufacturing lines.  
My work focused on process optimization, manpower efficiency (MOST), and production scaling.

Seeing AI being applied in industrial systems sparked my curiosity about intelligent software systems.

That curiosity led me into full-stack development, and eventually into Web3 — where decentralization, data ownership, and trustless systems completely changed how I think about technology.

## 🧠 What I Do Now

Currently working as a Frontend Developer, building high-performance interfaces and simulation-based financial products.

I actively explore:
- AI-native Web3 applications  
- Decentralized data ownership models  
- Trusted compute systems  
- Developer experience for protocol ecosystems  

I enjoy bridging complex backend/protocol systems with intuitive frontend experiences.
